# Decision-Maker

This was part of a project I completed in my own time to help myself make decisions.  I often rely on decision makers such as the online Magic 8 ball or the Oracle Fortune Teller to make simple life decisions such as, should I go trick-or-treat, or should I buy a Kit-Kat.  This is a program that allows the user to input a question in the console and will return an answer of yes or no based on random number generation and evaluation.
## Getting Started

I created this program on an IDE, specifically an Eclipse IDE with Java, so if you wish to run this code on your local machine, make sure to install the latest version of Java and Eclipse SE IDE.  To run this program, you only need to download and move these files into your workspace and open them as a new project.

### Prerequisites

You should install Eclipse and Java to run this program most effectively.

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
